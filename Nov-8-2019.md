### Website
I add the contact us, aboutus, shipping to the bottom of the website and made buttoms that link to it. I still need to workout how to make it looks good but it is there right now.
I also made the product carasel section not go past where the products end.
I fixed the footer section of the website so they link to the ebay contact, feeback, ect.
All the changes should show up at faveing.github.io

### Website
I need the buttons for the carasel, and the buttons under the banners to be designed. I also need the banner backgrounds designed. 
The footer section needs a design.

### Inventory Program
I added the ability to add items to the inventory.
